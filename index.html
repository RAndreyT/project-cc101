        <h2>Asian history</h2>
        <p2>South-eastern Asia or SEA, is the geographical south-eastern region of Asia, 
            consisting of the regions that are situated south of mainland China, east of the Indian subcontinent,
             and north-west of mainland Australia.    
             Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by East Asia, to the west by 
             South Asia and the Bay of Bengal, to the east by Oceania and the Pacific Ocean, 
             and to the south by Australia and the Indian Ocean. <br> <br>
             Apart from the British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of 26 atolls of Maldives in South Asia,
              Maritime Southeast Asia is the only other 
             subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere. Mainland Southeast Asia is completely in the Northern Hemisphere. 
             East Timor and the southern portion of Indonesia are the only parts that are south of the Equator.</p2>
